## Project

This website does not have subpages, but rather is one giant wall with all content layed out next to each other and a menu bar on top. All the columns of content can then be scrolled down to see more content.

Most content is shown in 2 languages, german and english, but also them are shown on the same page next to each other.

From left to right, we start with a intro and then go year by year (colloquia by colloquia) interrupted by some interview videos. At the very end, there is a table of participants.

## Stack
