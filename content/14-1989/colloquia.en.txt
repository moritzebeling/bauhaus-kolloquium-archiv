#### Development of Productive Forces and Environmental Design.
Social and scientific-technical progress in its effects on architecture and industrial design in our times.
The 100th Anniversary of Hannes Meyer

**Prof. Dr. Horst Siegel**
Director of the Colloquium

</div><div>

The Bauhaus Colloquium is an international forum for the history, theory and practice of urban development, architecture and industrial design in our era. In an interdisciplinary manner, it connects the discussion about actual developmental problems of society and construction, of architecture and product design, with the scientific reappraisal of progressive heritage. At the 5th International Bauhaus Colloquium, issues arising from the revolutionary changes in productive forces will be discussed, along with changes in the nature of work in our era, and in the structure of work and living environments, as well as urban planning. The colloquium is also committed to the productive development of Bauhaus heritage.

  blockquote: >
    „The GDR discovered the Bauhaus quite
    late, too late, in a way, because the
    international discourse was much more
    advanced. And it was, especially in the
    ‘80s, about postmodernism. It started
    with a criticism of modernism – in
    fact, with a massive criticism of
    modernism. Now you have to imagine, the
    GDR discovers the Bauhaus late, takes
    immediate ownership of it. To a certain
    degree it explains – in the same style
    as the other doctrine – the Bauhaus as
    the new doctrine. I was strictly against
    it.“
