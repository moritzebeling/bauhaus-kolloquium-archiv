Biography: **Bruno Flierl** studied architecture at the Hochschule der Künste Berlin and at the Weimar HAB. From 1952 to 1961, and 1965 to 1979, he worked as a research assistant at the Institute of Urban Development and Architecture in the GDR Bauakademie, in the Department of the History and Theory of Architecture. Between 1962 and 1964, he was the editor-in-chief of Deutsche Architektur magazine. Later, in the 1970s, he was a guest lecturer at the Kunsthochschule and Humboldt University in Berlin; and from 1980 to 1984, he was also an assistant professor at Humboldt. After retiring, he continued to work as an architecture and city critic, and published numerous works about the urban planning complications arising from the process of uniting east and west in Berlin.
