#### Bauhaus Heritage and the Contemporary Development of Architecture.
The 100th Anniversary of Walter Gropius

**Prof. Dr. Christian Schädlich**
Director of the Colloquium

On the occasion of the 3rd International Bauhaus-Colloquium, researchers, architects, designers, and artists met in Weimar to exchange productive ideas about the design of our structural, spatial and objective environments. Following on the tradition of the 1976 and 1979 colloquia, the Bauhaus remained the historical point of reference. But, more than ever, we were searching for a connection with the current tasks of the architect, not just in the sense of a continuation of progressive Bauhaus traditions, but above all through a focus on the contemporary problems of architecture. One of the colloquium’s aims was to use the reappraisal of historical values to provide some professional orientation for architects in the present socialist society. For us, it was encouraging that our attempt to connect history and the present, and theory and practice, in a productive way was positively received by the participants. We very much appreciate that the colloquium with the “call from Weimar” committed itself to the fight for peace, which is inconceivable without architectural progress.
