Title: Das Internationale Bauhaus-Kolloquium in Weimar 1976 bis 2016:

Text: 

In the 1960s, after the tabooing of the Bauhaus in the GDR, discussion at the Hochschule für Architektur und Bauwesen (HAB) Weimar concerning the reappraisal of Bauhaus history went in two directions: In Dessau, the rescue of its architectural heritage was practically supported; whereas in Weimar they began an academic reevaluation of their own history and, along with that, a history of the Bauhaus Weimar. In the early 1970s, an independent view of Bauhaus history arose, and it became accepted as heritage. The International Bauhaus-Colloquia are a result of and a contribution to this process.

The first part of the exhibition, titled **prologue**, documents the efforts to reassess the Bauhaus heritage in Weimar, points to the relations between Dessau and Weimar and traces the contributions of the HAB to the renovation of the Bauhaus building in Dessau. Today, these topics remain in need of further research. In this way, the exhibition can be seen as an impetus for targeted research.

The second part of the exhibition, titled **development**, reviews the history of the International Bauhaus-Colloquia from 1976 to 2016. Documents, photographs and conversations with organizers, speakers and guests reveal the forty-year history of this prestigious conference as a historiographical institution – a barometer within a changing political and cultural landscape. For, while before the political transformation of 1989, the colloquium had been a place in which speakers used the then-officially-endorsed reception of the Bauhaus in order to test the expanding limits of what could be said under a slowly melting authoritarian regime; after the “Wende”, speakers and guests continued to move outwards in an attempt to present knowledge about the whereabouts of objects and protagonists of the Bauhaus, or about archiving and conservation initiatives, as well as questions about the history and theory of architecture and its connection to politics.
