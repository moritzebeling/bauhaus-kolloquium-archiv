#### Architecture and Power.

**Prof. Gerd Zimmermann**
Director of the Colloquium

The international Bauhaus-Colloquium in 1992 was not only the sixth scientific event in a row in Weimar, it was also, after the fall of the Wall, the first Bauhaus-Colloquium, where topics within the scientific dialogue could be freely selected. (…) Around 250 architects, art historians, economic theorists, social theorists and students were invited to deal with the relationship between architecture and power. Those who thought that the topic was chosen just to get revenge on the architectural consequences of the GDR’s mechanisms of rule were wrong; as were those who just connected the topic of power with the political architecture of the Third Reich. Of course these issues played a role. The colloquium was organized so that the whole spectrum of the topic could be discussed; meaning, not just the politically symbolic value of architecture, but also the interaction between architecture and economic power. Not just the present, but also the history. (…) In the discussion, some basic topics dominated, especially the dispute about modernism and postmodernism and the affinity of each with the issue of power. There were speeches in which the value of the social objectives and the critical avantgarde in the earlier modern period were pointed out; while at the same time, the arbitrariness and the non-binding character of postmodernism was criticized. In contrast was the statement that modernism, after its early pluralistic stage, had somehow become a doctrine, with devastating consequences for the modern city and architecture, and that postmodernism had its merit in the fact that it broke this doctrine and signified liberation.

– Gerd Zimmermann, excerpt from the introduction to the Colloquium

    “After the fall of the Wall, right at
    the moment when relationships were
    really being reoriented and reorganized,
    there was an opening, that’s what I
    personally felt, also for contradictory
    positions, which hadn’t been so
    welcome in public before. For example, I
    was extremely surprised when I realized
    that at these conferences, people were
    explicitly dealing with architectural
    theoretical models and were particularly
    interested in postmodernism.”
