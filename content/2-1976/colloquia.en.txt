    “In 1976, when this so-called
    “WKZ,” the “Wissenschaftlich
    Kulturelle Zentrum” at the Bauhaus
    Dessau was founded, many former Bauhaus
    students from the East and also the West
    joined together there. Most were almost
    already retirement age, and they all
    came together the ones from East Germany
    were particularly happy that their
    Bauhaus was finally perceived in a
    positive way, and there are beautiful
    photos, where you can see them. There
    was Richard Paulick next to Max Bill,
    next to Franz Ehrlich, next to Marianne
    Brandt, and many others. And so the
    Bauhaus in Dessau became a place, where,
    among others, former Bauhaus students
    and also teachers – if they were still
    alive – met, made close relationships,
    as you’ve already heard in other
    interviews, along with the Bauhaus
    colloquia in Weimar, which began in
    1976. So Dessau was then one stop in a
    series of events that lasted for several
    days.”

On the occasion of the 50th anniversary of the opening of the Bauhaus Dessau, the “Hochschule für Architektur und Bauwesen” (HAB) Weimar, together with the “Bauakademie” of the GDR and the “Hochschule für Industrielle Formgestaltung” Halle, Burg Giebichenstein, organized a scientific colloquium from October 27-29, 1976 in Weimar. Among those present were former members of the Bauhaus, researchers of GDR-Bauhaus studies, as well as famous foreign guests such as Max Bill, Edmund Goldzamt, Edith Horváth, Claude Schnaidt, Francesco Dal Co, and Marco De Michelis. The colloquium was accompanied by an exhibition about the work of the second Bauhaus director, Hannes Meyer, as Lena Meyer-Bergner had provided numerous documents to the university.

The first scientific colloquium about the Bauhaus at the Weimarer Hochschule clarified, also on an international level, the directional change in the cultural politics of the GDR, which was paralleled by the historical analysis of Bauhaus heritage. It also laid the foundations for the HAB as the centre of Bauhaus research in the GDR.

In this context, in order to prepare for further colloquia, exhibitions and research projects, a permanent working group for Bauhaus research was established, which had the task to concentrate on Bauhaus research. As such die colloquium will become a central forum for national and international Bauhaus research in the GDR.
