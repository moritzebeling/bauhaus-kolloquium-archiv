    “In 1976, when this so-called
    “WKZ,” the “Wissenschaftlich
    Kulturelle Zentrum” at the Bauhaus
    Dessau was founded, many former Bauhaus
    students from the East and also the West
    joined together there. Most were almost
    already retirement age, and they all
    came together the ones from East Germany
    were particularly happy that their
    Bauhaus was finally perceived in a
    positive way, and there are beautiful
    photos, where you can see them. There
    was Richard Paulick next to Max Bill,
    next to Franz Ehrlich, next to Marianne
    Brandt, and many others. And so the
    Bauhaus in Dessau became a place, where,
    among others, former Bauhaus students
    and also teachers – if they were still
    alive – met, made close relationships,
    as you’ve already heard in other
    interviews, along with the Bauhaus
    colloquia in Weimar, which began in
    1976. So Dessau was then one stop in a
    series of events that lasted for several
    days.”

#### Re-Opening of the Bauhaus Building Dessau<br />4th December 1976</div>
<div>

Fifty years after the official opening ceremony of the Bauhaus building on December 4, 1926 that inaugurated the new workplace of the Hochschule für Gestaltung, the building was reopened after extensive renovations. (In the **Prologue** of this exhibition the backstory of the renovation is presented in more detail.) It is interesting to note that the first colloquium in Weimar took place a few weeks before the reopening of the Bauhaus Dessau. In their lectures, Bernd Grönwald, Adalbert Behr and Hans Berger all made reference to the reconstruction of the Bauhaus building in Dessau, but no official standpoint was yet taken on the historiographical classification and reworking of “Bauhaus heritage” in the GDR.

The uncertainty about the recent re-orientation of GDR cultural policy is reflected in the structure of the program for the Dessau reopening ceremony. In his article, published in the ZEIT on December 10, 1976, the West-German journalist Manfred Sack called the opening ceremony in the Bauhaus building Dessau a “party without celebration”. He compares the “fabulous party” for the opening of the. Bauhaus on December 4, 1926, which lasted until the morning hours, with the jubilee celebration fifty years later. He describes the celebrations as a “bitter and deadly serious act of state”: “And the chamber orchestra on stage also didn´t play anything that musicians like Paul Hindemith and Kurt Weill, Bartók or Eisler had produced at the time of the Bauhaus, but rather some Bach and some Händel. (...) It was not a Bauhaus party like those that the Bauhäusler always spoke of so dreamily, this time, the Bauhaus remained dark in the evening. People stayed home while the 120 celebrities were in the Hotel Stadt Dessau, feasting on what two delivery vans had brought in sealed boxes that morning.”

#### 50 Years Bauhaus Dessau

**Prof. Dr. Christian Schädlich**
Director of the Colloquium
 
</div><div>

On the occasion of the 50th anniversary of the opening of the Bauhaus Dessau, the “Hochschule für Architektur und Bauwesen” (HAB) Weimar, together with the “Bauakademie” of the GDR and the “Hochschule für Industrielle Formgestaltung” Halle, Burg Giebichenstein, organized a scientific colloquium from October 27-29, 1976 in Weimar. Among those present were former members of the Bauhaus, researchers of GDR-Bauhaus studies, as well as famous foreign guests such as Max Bill, Edmund Goldzamt, Edith Horváth, Claude Schnaidt, Francesco Dal Co, and Marco De Michelis. The colloquium was accompanied by an exhibition about the work of the second Bauhaus director, Hannes Meyer, as Lena Meyer-Bergner had provided numerous documents to the university.

The first scientific colloquium about the Bauhaus at the Weimarer Hochschule clarified, also on an international level, the directional change in the cultural politics of the GDR, which was paralleled by the historical analysis of Bauhaus heritage. It also laid the foundations for the HAB as the centre of Bauhaus research in the GDR.

In this context, in order to prepare for further colloquia, exhibitions and research projects, a permanent working group for Bauhaus research was established, which had the task to concentrate on Bauhaus research. As such die colloquium will become a central forum for national and international Bauhaus research in the GDR.
