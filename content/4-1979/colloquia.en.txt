    “The Bauhaus Colloquium was quite interesting, because the last Bauhäusler joined once again. Max Bill was there, Lena Meyer-Bergner, Hannes Meyer’s wife was also there. Georg Muche was there, he was still alive, and also the first representatives of the friends of the Hochschule für Architektur und Bauwesen came from abroad: Claude Schnaidt, the Swiss-Frenchman, the author of the first study about Hannes Meyer. Jonas Geist didn’t belong to that circle of friends; he came later.
    But, for example, Edmund Goldzamt from Poland was there, so it was quite interesting. And there began a friendship that became more and more important for me.”

**Prof. Dr. Christian Schädlich**
Director of the Colloquium

The tradition of the International Bauhaus-Colloquia, which continue as academic conferences to this day, was, to a certain degree, established during the second Bauhaus-Colloquium. On the occasion of the 60th anniversary of the opening of the Bauhaus, the colloquium tasked itself more specifically to research the history of the Bauhaus. Bernd Grönwald’s presentation dealt with the significance of maintenance of Bauhaus heritage in the GDR, and Christian Schädlich wrote an essay about the history of the Bauhaus in Weimar, which was presented in public for the first time, and made available to all participants. Former Bauhaus members and international researchers were among the participants. And for the first time, the Berlin Bauhaus archive was present, represented by its director Hans Maria Wingler and Peter Hahn. An exhibition titled Bauhaus 1919-1933, which was curated together with the Kunstsammlungen zu Weimar and inaugurated in the Kunsthalle at Theaterplatz, accompanied the conference program. For the first time in the GDR, the historical sites of the Bauhaus, as well as its artistic and educational achievements, were presented to the broader public. Through the colloquium and associated exhibition, the Weimarer Hochschule aimed to connect with international Bauhaus research and to develop an independent historical view of the Bauhaus.
