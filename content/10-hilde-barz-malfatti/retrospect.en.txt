Biography: 

**Hilde Barz-Malfatti** is Professor of Design and Urban Architecture at the Bauhaus University Weimar. She studied architecture at the TU Darmstadt and worked as a freelancer for various architecture and urban planning offices between 1979 and 1985. Since 1985, she has worked as a self-employed architect and urban planner in Berlin. From 1985 to 1990, she carried out a research assistantship with Professor Alfred Grazioli at the Hochschule der Künste Berlin (HdK) in the Department of Architecture, Urban Development Design, and between 1990 and 1992, she was a lecturer at the HdK. She has been a member of the Institute for European Urbanism at the Bauhaus University since 2010.

When she was invited to the Bauhaus Colloquium as Grazioli’s research assistant, she drove beyond the Iron Curtain and into the GDR for the first time in her life. Some of the speakers who impressed her at that colloquium would later become her colleagues when she was appointed professor in Weimar in 1994.
